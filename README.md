# Campbell-Cochrane Habit Model

This repository contains an implementation of the Campbell-Cochrane habit model for asset pricing, which assumes price-consumption ratio is a function $v$ of consumption surplus. A dense neural network is trained to obtain the coordinates (i.e., optimal weights) of the projection of $v$ onto Chebyshev's polynomial space.
